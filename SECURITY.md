# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of the codebase is supported when a new update is released. To ensure you are always running supported code, pull changes from this repository as often as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities may be reported through the repository [issues](https://github.com/cm090/gradescope-autograder/issues) section. When the project is in active development, updates can be expected on a weekly basis at minimum. Higher risk vulnerabilities will receive top priority in the processing queue.

Most reproducible vulnerabilities will be accepted. If this is not the case, an explanation will be provided as to why the issue is not of concern.
